# Vizora Roadmap

> Vizora is a schema intelligence platform focused on clarity, trust, and developer experience.  
> This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of core capabilities.

---

## 🚀 Vision

Turn database schemas into:
- Visual diagrams
- Living documentation
- Verifiable AI answers

All without connecting to a live database.

---

## 🧩 Core Principles

- Schema-first (no runtime DB access)
- Evidence-based AI
- Calm, developer-focused UX
- No generic dashboards or bloated features

---

## ✅ Now (In Progress)

### Platform Foundations
- [ ] Schema paste & normalization (SQL / Prisma)
- [ ] Schema versioning system
- [ ] Global sidebar navigation
- [ ] User dashboard (identity, usage, billing, team)
- [ ] Edit profile flow (inline / drawer)

### Visualization
- [ ] Auto ER diagram generation
- [ ] Schema explorer (tables, columns, relations)
- [ ] Click-to-highlight relationships

---

## 🧠 Intelligence (High Priority)

### Schema Review
- [ ] Detect missing primary keys
- [ ] Detect missing indexes on foreign keys
- [ ] Flag large / risky tables
- [ ] Naming consistency checks
- [ ] Severity-based insights (critical / warning / suggestion)

### Ask Schema (Verified AI)
- [ ] Schema-constrained AI answers
- [ ] Show schema version used
- [ ] Show referenced tables & columns
- [ ] Validate AI output server-side
- [ ] Explicit “cannot determine from schema” handling

### Auto Onboarding Guide
- [ ] Identify core tables
- [ ] Explain key relationships
- [ ] Highlight risky / legacy areas
- [ ] Generate Markdown output
- [ ] Version guide with schema

---

## 📄 Documentation

### Living Docs
- [ ] Auto-generate schema docs
- [ ] Tie docs strictly to schema versions
- [ ] Markdown export
- [ ] Read-only docs per version

### Schema Intent Layer
- [ ] Canonical intent notes per table
- [ ] Canonical intent notes per column
- [ ] Versioned edits
- [ ] Used as AI context (read-only)

---

## 👥 Teams

- [ ] Workspace support (solo / team)
- [ ] Invite team members
- [ ] Role management (admin / member)
- [ ] Shared schema access
- [ ] Team activity log

---

## 💳 Billing

- [ ] Free / Pro / Teams plans
- [ ] Usage-based limits (projects, AI queries)
- [ ] Plan-aware feature gating
- [ ] Clear upgrade paths
- [ ] Billing status visibility in dashboard

---

## 🎨 UX & Design

- [ ] Modern landing page
- [ ] Background 3D floating cards (hero)
- [ ] Subtle click & press animations
- [ ] Calm motion system (Framer Motion)
- [ ] Skeleton loading states
- [ ] Reduced-motion accessibility support

---

## 🔒 Security & Trust

- [ ] Schema-only processing guarantee
- [ ] No credential storage
- [ ] Clear “no DB connection” messaging
- [ ] Activity logs for key actions

---

## 📦 Export & Sharing

- [ ] PNG export (diagrams)
- [ ] SVG export (diagrams)
- [ ] Markdown export (docs & onboarding)
- [ ] Shareable read-only links (future)

---

## 🔮 Future (Exploratory)

- [ ] Schema diff view between versions
- [ ] CI-friendly schema checks (read-only)
- [ ] Schema vocabulary mapping
- [ ] Public schema examples gallery

---

## 🛑 Explicitly Out of Scope

- ❌ Live database connections
- ❌ Query execution
- ❌ Observability / metrics
- ❌ Generic AI chat
- ❌ Infrastructure dashboards

---

## 📢 Build in Public

Vizora is built openly.  
Feedback, issues, and feature requests are welcome.
